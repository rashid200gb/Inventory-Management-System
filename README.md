Tech Stack:

Streamlit - Web framework for building data apps in Python.
Code Structure:

The code is organized into several classes:

Product: Represents a product with attributes like product ID, name, category, price, and stock quantity.
Inventory: Manages the product inventory by adding, editing, deleting, and displaying products.
WebLogin: Handles user login and authentication.
Session State:
The app utilizes Streamlit session state to store user authentication status, current user information, and the product inventory across app sessions.

Add user roles and permissions for more control over user actions.
Login:
Start by logging in with a username and password. The default login is:
Username: admin
Password: admin123

Inventory Management:

Once logged in, use the dropdown menu to choose one of the following actions:
Add Product: Enter the product details and click "Add Product".
Edit Product: Provide the Product ID of the product to edit, then update the details.
Delete Product: Enter the Product ID of the product to delete.
Display Products: View all products currently in inventory.

User Management:

The admin user can add new users from the "Add User" option.
Click "Logout" to end the session.

Code Structure

Product Class: Represents a product with an ID, name, category, price, and stock quantity.
Inventory Class: Manages the product list, with methods to add, edit, delete, and display products.

Only the admin user has permission to add new users.
Future Improvements
Add more detailed product search and filtering options.
