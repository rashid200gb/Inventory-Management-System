            "\n",
            "*   **Type 1 Diabetes:** This is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This means the body produces little to no insulin, a hormone needed to allow glucose (sugar) to enter cells for energy. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence, but can occur at any age. It requires lifelong insulin therapy.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Type 2 Diabetes:** This is the most common type of diabetes. It occurs when the body doesn't make enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces (insulin resistance). This leads to a buildup of glucose in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and family history. It can often be managed with lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), oral medications, or insulin therapy.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Gestational Diabetes:** This type develops during pregnancy. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to insulin resistance. It usually resolves after delivery but increases the mother's risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. It requires careful monitoring and management.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "    *   **Monogenic Diabetes:** This is a rare form caused by a genetic defect affecting insulin production or action.\n",
            "    *   **Diabetes due to other diseases:** Certain diseases like cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis can damage the pancreas and lead to diabetes.\n",
            "    *   **Drug-induced diabetes:** Some medications can cause diabetes as a side effect.\n",

            "It's important to note that symptoms of diabetes can vary, but common signs include increased thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's crucial to consult a doctor for diagnosis and management.\n"
